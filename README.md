# NativeDownladerAndroidTest

##This is a sample app just to see if downloading images,files, etc. via an NDK 

Purspose is to test which downloading is faster. E.g. with Picasso (great lib btw) or with C++ .so lib. 
Not sure if I am measuring performance correctly and it has issues loading image from file into a bitmap. 
Suggestions/improvements are welcome with pull requests.
